# SocialPlacesClient

This is an example to use Angular version 6.1.2 to connect to a Symfony 4 application and make a simple POST request.

**Prerequisites:** NodeJS

## Getting Started

  1. `git clone https://github.com/adeadedoja/dami-social-places-client.git`
  2. `cd dami-social-places-client`
  3. `npm install`
  4. `edit /src/app/api.service.ts for the API URL to connect to`
  5. `ng serve`

The above will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
